# SVG-Animation-With-CSS
For this you will need to install FIGMA. Open src unDraw.
First go to unDraw choos picture you want to animate.
Second step is to open that picture in figma.
When you've had open that change objects as you like. And groupe seperatly.
In this example I grouped hat,man on the bike and wheels. You can see it in svg and index file the id of each one. 
Animation is shown in style css.
